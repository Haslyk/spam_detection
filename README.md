# A Hybrid AI Framework for Spam Email Classification

This repository contains the source code for the paper: "A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Framework for Spam Email Classification Using Deep and Structural Features", providing the necessary components to reproduce our main findings.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Haslyk/spam_detection.git
    cd spam_detection
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the Dataset**
    Please download the `balanced_dataset.csv` file from the link provided in the `data/README.md` file and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Reproducing Results

To train the models and reproduce the key performance metrics reported in our paper (e.g., Table 4 and Table X), open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

`notebooks/Train_and_Evaluate_Models.ipynb`

The notebook is self-contained and provides step-by-step execution of the modeling pipeline, from data loading to final evaluation.
